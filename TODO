# TODO List

[] Add mini-batch or stochastic gradient descent variants
[] Implement convergence criteria (early stopping)
[] Export results to file
[] Add unit tests
[] Better logs
[] Better initial random start for slope and bias
[] Add more plots:
    [] Cost vs Epochs curve
    [] Fitted line over noisy data points
    [] Final estimated slope and bias printed via logs
